As we are all aware, in any work environment there will be questions that need quick 
answers and alot of them. 
However, nobody wants to take on their own responsibilities as well as having to answer 
everyone's questions. And we've all had at least one experience where we wish we could 
have found the answer on our own and goten right back to work with out the hassle of too 
much searching. This is exactly where knowledge management comes into play.(CLICK) 
It is much easier and much more reasonable for people to be able to find answers to 
their own questions with something as simple as a few keywords.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There are several lifecycle models that are generally accepted but they all have a few 
things in common. Those things are: (CLICK)


In the acquisition stage of the lifecycle, information is gathered for use within 
knowledge bases. Also, data is collected for things such as credibility, 
cost and accuracy. All things that are necessary to help ensure that this information 
is of the highest quality. Thus ensuring that downstream products are also of higher
quality thus reducing but not eliminating audits needed for the information. (CLICK)

In the refinement stage, things like restructuring, labeling and indexing take place.
This will add value to the knowledge management by creating easy-to-read and 
organized content for future use.(CLICK)

The storagestep is quite self explanatory, whether in a database or knowledge 
management software like Zendesk, safe and organized storage of information 
is vital to a company's success. (CLICK)

the distribution step refers to how the product will be delivered, such as the medium 
of delivery but also other factors such as language. This ensures that the information 
is available to all who may need it.

The final step is presentation, this step tells you how how well you performed with 
your previous steps and how much value each of them added to your final product. 
This will also give you feedback that will help you go through the cycle again but end 
up with a better product.

Knowledge management is a very important yet often overlooked part of IT Service 
Management. Knowledge Management directly supports every other step in the ITSM Lifecycle.
Without it, you would see slower resolution times, and thus less resolved incidents. 
This will ultimately lead to overspending of company resources. Following these few steps 
will help any organization to support their employees and customers. But most of all, 
it will set them up for continuous future success and growth.
